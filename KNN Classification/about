K-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) classification is a supervised machine learning algorithm that uses a data point's neighboring classifications to predict its class.
It's a non-parametric algorithm that's often used for classification problems

How it works:
1. Choose the number of nearest neighbors(k).
2. Calculate the distance between the query point and the dataset points
3. Sort and select the k-nearest neighbours.
4. Assign a class label based on the majority of the nearest neighbors

When It is useful:
KNN is useful when labeled data is expensive or difficult to obtain
It can achieve high accuracy for a wide range of prediction problems
