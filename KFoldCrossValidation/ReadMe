What is Cross-Validation?
Cross validation is a technique used in machine learning to evaluate the performance of a model on unseen data. It involves dividing the available data into multiple folds or subsets, using one of these folds as a validation set, and training the model on the remaining folds. This process is repeated multiple times, each time using a different fold as the validation set. Finally, the results from each validation step are averaged to produce a more robust estimate of the model’s performance. Cross validation is an important step in the machine learning process and helps to ensure that the model selected for deployment is robust and generalizes well to new data.

What is cross-validation used for?
The main purpose of cross validation is to prevent overfitting, which occurs when a model is trained too well on the training data and performs poorly on new, unseen data. By evaluating the model on multiple validation sets, cross validation provides a more realistic estimate of the model’s generalization performance, i.e., its ability to perform well on new, unseen data.

Types of Cross-Validation
There are several types of cross validation techniques, including k-fold cross validation, leave-one-out cross validation, and Holdout validation, Stratified Cross-Validation. The choice of technique depends on the size and nature of the data, as well as the specific requirements of the modeling problem.
